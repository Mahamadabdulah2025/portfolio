                            <p> In this project, we designed and developed an AI-based unmanned vehicle for
                                surveillance and protection. The project aimed to create an autonomous vehicle
                                that could be used for surveillance and protection in various settings, such as
                                border patrol, public safety, and military operations. The system consisted of a
                                remotely controlled vehicle, AI algorithms, and various sensors and cameras for
                                data collection. </p>
                        <p class="hidden">AI-based unmanned ground vehicles for surveillance and protection with 
                            360 cameras work by using advanced sensor technology and artificial intelligence algorithms to detect
                            and respond to potential threats. The vehicles are equipped with a 360-degree camera, which captures a 
                            panoramic view of the surroundings.
                            <br>The cameras can capture high-quality video footage and images, which are then 
                            analyzed by AI algorithms in real-time. The AI algorithms can detect and track people, 
                            vehicles, and objects of interest, allowing the vehicle to respond appropriately to potential threats.
                            For example, if the vehicle detects an intruder, it can alert security personnel or activate an alarm.
                            <br>In addition to the 360-degree camera, unmanned ground vehicles can also be equipped with other sensors, 
                            such as lidar, radar, and thermal imaging cameras, to provide additional situational awareness. The data collected by
                            these sensors is processed by AI algorithms to identify potential threats and respond accordingly.
                            <br>These vehicles can operate autonomously, with pre-programmed routes and actions, or they can be remotely
                            controlled by human operators. They can be used in a variety of settings, including military and border security,
                            public safety, and commercial applications.
                            <br>Overall, AI-based unmanned ground vehicles with 360 cameras provide an effective and efficient way to enhance 
                            surveillance and protection in various settings. With advancements in sensor technology and AI algorithms, these vehicles
                            will continue to evolve and become an integral part of security systems in the future. </p>

                            <p>In this project, we designed and developed a system that uses a fan and a
                                Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) that are coupled together to
                                regenerate electricity. The project aimed to demonstrate the potential of using a
                                fan to produce electricity, especially in areas where fan rotates continously. The
                                system consisted of a PMSG, a rectifier circuit, and a battery bank to store the
                                regenerated electricity.</p>
                            <p class="hidden">The regeneration of electricity using a fan and a PMSG (Permanent Magnet Synchronous 
                                Generator) works by converting the mechanical energy of the fan into electrical energy using the PMSG.
                                <br>When the fan rotates, it generates mechanical energy. The mechanical energy is then transferred to 
                                the PMSG, which converts it into electrical energy through electromagnetic induction. The PMSG is equipped
                                with permanent magnets that create a magnetic field that interacts with the rotating magnetic field 
                                created by the fan's rotor, inducing an electrical current in the stator coils.
                                <br>The electrical energy produced by the PMSG can be used to power other devices or can be 
                                stored in a battery for later use. This system is often used in renewable energy applications,
                                such as wind turbines and hydroelectric power plants, to harness the power of natural sources of energy.
                                <br>The PMSG system is highly efficient, as it can generate electricity with minimal friction and
                                mechanical losses. Additionally, the use of permanent magnets in the PMSG eliminates the need for
                                a separate power source to create a magnetic field, making it more cost-effective and reliable.
                                <br>Overall, the regeneration of electricity using a fan and a PMSG is a practical and sustainable 
                                way to generate electricity from mechanical energy. It can be used in a variety of applications, such
                                as energy harvesting and renewable energy systems, to provide a reliable source of electricity.</p>

                        <div class="cont">
                            <p> In this project, we designed and developed a system that uses a fan and a
                                Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) that are coupled together to

                            <p class="hidden"> A hybrid power plant is a system that combines two or more types of power 
                                generation technologies to produce electricity. The most common types of technologies used in a
                                hybrid power plant are renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro, and non-renewable
                                energy sources such as diesel or gas generators.<br>
                                The working of a hybrid power plant involves using the renewable energy sources to generate 
                                electricity during peak times, while the non-renewable energy sources are used during off-peak 
                                times or when renewable energy sources are not available.<br>
                                For example, during the day, when there is ample sunlight, solar panels can generate 
                                electricity, and excess energy can be stored in batteries for use at night or when there 
                                is no sunlight. Similarly, wind turbines can generate electricity when there is wind, and 
                                the excess energy can be stored in batteries or used to power the grid.<br>
                                During times when renewable sources are not available, the non-renewable sources 
                                such as diesel or gas generators can be used to provide a continuous supply of electricity
                                to the grid. The hybrid power plant system can be automated to switch between different energy
                                sources based on the availability and demand of electricity.<br>
                                The use of a hybrid power plant offers several advantages, such as reducing dependence 
                                on non-renewable energy sources and reducing carbon emissions. It also provides a more reliable
                                source of electricity, as the different energy sources complement each other, ensuring a steady
                                supply of electricity.<br>
                                In conclusion, a hybrid power plant system is an innovative and sustainable way 
                                to generate electricity. It offers a cost-effective and reliable source of energy that
                                can reduce our reliance on non-renewable energy sources and help mitigate the effects of
                                climate change.</p>
